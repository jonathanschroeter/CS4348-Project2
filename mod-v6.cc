Team Members: Jonathan Schroeter (Jas170005@utdallas.edu) and Caleb Munson (ccm170000@utdallas.edu)

Work: 	Program was worked on at the same time by both members for all parts. No work was divided.
	Code Comments: Jonathan Schroeter
	README: Caleb Munson	

Date: 4/29/2021

Class: CS/SE 4348.006

How the Program is Run: The program is compiled by using g++ mod-v6.cc, then ran by running ./a.out

MAJOR DECISIONS MADE:
	-If free[] and nfree are stored in a data block, that block is no longer free
		-At those data blocks, only nfree and free[] are stored
	-After "initfs" has been run, "openfs" must be run again in order for "initfs" to be run
	-count-free can only be run after "openfs" and "initfs" have been run
	-If a file does not exist when running "openfs", the file will be created
